# Jen Thompson - Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a software engineer. The design reflects a "sunset beach" theme with vibrant, warm colors and a clean, user-friendly layout. It includes sections such as "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume."

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar:** A sticky navigation bar at the top allows users to easily navigate between sections.
- **Projects Section:** The portfolio section displays project cards with background images, titles, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form:** A contact form allows visitors to send messages.
- **Styling:** Custom CSS was used throughout to bring the sunset beach theme to life.

## Built With
